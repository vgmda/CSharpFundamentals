After completing this module, I've built a solid foundation on C# concepts and techniques used in development. The test project that was provided was helpful for many reasons, it highlighted the use of C# language as a part of OOP and its best practices. The topic that I found useful was the 'Unit Testing' part, which showed me how important is to test your program step by step while in development. Overall, I enjoyed exploring the different aspects provided by this module and would definitely recommend it to anyone in need to brush over the basics of C#.
